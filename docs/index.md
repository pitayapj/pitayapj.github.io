## Hi :wave_tone2:{ .wave }
YouTube! What is behind its fast loading and adblock-prevention function.

In this blog, surely you will not find out anything related about that.
I'm just a mid-tier engineer. Fortunate enough to be where I am now.

But I do watch YouTube though, I guess a lot of us are. 
Most of my watched videos are short clips from Friends or The Office TV series. 
There are a few science channels that I also enjoy watching. One of those is **Veritasium**. 

!!! quote "Derek Muller from Veritasium"
    You have to demonstrate that you can do what you wanna do.

The website originate idea was a place for me to write down what I have done in my career, a away to improving my writing skill, maybe a note here and there about my life. 

But influenced by Derek, I think this website can also be a perfect place for me to show you (a few unfortunate reader) what I can do.

## So, let's get on to it, shall we!!
??? note "Disclaimer"
    Like I said, the website is a note for myself. I might leave some information out, or outright missing some, so please read with careful consideration. 

    Still, love to have you here. Feedbacks are always appreciated. :smile:
