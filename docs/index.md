## Hi :wave_tone2:
I watch YouTube a lot, maybe a lot of us are. 
But not all of my watched video are memes and short clips from Friends and The Office. 

There are a few science channels that I also enjoy watching. One of those is **Veritasium**. 

!!! quote "Derek Muller from Veritasium"
    You have to demonstrate that you can do what you wanna do

The website originate idea was this is a place for me to note down what I have done in my career, maybe to also improving my writing skill. 

But along that, I think this website can also be a perfect place for me to show you(a few unfortunate reader) what I can do.

<h2>So, let's get on to it, shall we!! </h2>

??? note "Disclaimer"
    Like I said, the website is a note for myself. I might left some information out so please read with careful consideration. 

    Love to have your feedbacks still/ :smile:
