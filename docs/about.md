Hi, my name is Hoang Thanh Long.

In Vietnam's former language script (which inherited from China's characters and still use occasional till this day), 

Thanh Long means Blue Dragon.

Ironically, Thanh Long means dragon fruit in modern Vietnamese. 

As a child, I think that you always hate when people make fun of you for whatever reason. You did't know that it's actually mean nothing and the kids make fun of you didn't even know better neither. So do I, that's why I was always stupidly hesitant when someone asking for my name. 

But for a long long time, even since　high school I think. I always enjoy sharing a laugh or two with new friend when I tell them my name.

The Pitaya name come to me when I joined my current company here in Japan. They have a very fun idea of everyone can choose their own nickname before joining. Dragon fruit as nickname was my first thought but it's too long in Japanese (ドラゴンフルーツ).  

And ... what do you know, a different name of dragon fruit is Pitaya. Which I think I read it from dragon fruit's Wikipedia. It's also way easier when you spell it in Japanese (ぴたや).

So, this is a Pitaya's blog, a dragon fruit's blog or Thanh Long's blog :smile:
