# About Devops

!!! note "Working In Process"

I still remember chemistry class in highschool, chemical reaction between A and B create C and D. A reaction sometime can only happen if there is presence of a substance X, which is not consumed by the reaction and remain unchanged after. Or catalyst.

Catalyst helps reaction occur, react faster or even prevent reverse reaction (C and D turning back to A and B).

I think Devops, or Devops engineer is exactly like the X factor catalyst. He should be the one who enabling developers to build, to develop and delivery their system to production.

So, catalyst of software development, Devops!
